## 1. More Data, More Dynamics

I included more demographics and more risk factors. Placed additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. I attempted to create three for each axis, but I could not complete it.



## 2. Incorporate d3-tip

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Entered tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Added tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
